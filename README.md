### plot_metadata.csv
This file contains metadata associated with each plot. The following columns are included:
- **plotID**: unique plot identifier in the format *plot_treatment_TSI*.
- **plot**: code identifying each plot within *site* (Fraser, 'FR'), *block replicate* (A-D), and *plot number* (1-5).
- **block**: code identifying the treatment replicate containing each plot, A-D.
- **treatment**: silvicultural treatment received in 1940, classified by cutting intensity: control (no _), light, moderate, heavy, clearcut.
- **TSI**: presence (Y) or absence (N) of additional timber stand improvement (TSI) cutting.
- **date**: calendar date of field data collection (YYYYMMDD).
- **aspect_deg**: aspect at plot center, measured in degrees using a compass.
- **slope_deg**: slope at plot center, measured in degrees using a TruPulse 200 laser rangefinder. 
- **elevation_m**: elevation at plot center, measured in meters using a Garmin GPS unit.
